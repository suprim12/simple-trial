### Hi I have completed the site however I haven't make it responsive and used standard method to develop using husky, eslint, typescript, lint stage and git flow. Instead I have added some webgl to images on hover and smooth scroll.

Total Time Spent: 5 hours
Started Today

Note:
I have used my old code to develop faster.
